# Overview
This recipe is definitely going to be experimented on many times to find better doughs, sauces, and other combinations to make the perfect pizza. For this recipe I'm only focusing on the dough.

Yield: 4 12" pizzas

# Ingredients

* **950 g** bread flour
* **11 g** kosher salt
* **6 g** instant yeast
* **2 tsp** sugar
* **3 cups** lukewarm water (620g)
* **1 tbsp** olive oil

# Steps
1. In mixer, mix flour, salt, yeast, and sugar until well combined.
2. Add in water and olive oil, knead with dough hook for 5 minutes
3. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes
4. Knead again with dough hook for 3 minutes.
5. Divide dough into 4 parts, transfer to oiled large resealable container (tupperware)
6. Let dough rise in ambient temperature for 3 hours
7. Move dough to refrigerator, best results with 24-48 hours of refrigerator rest
8. When ready, remove dough from refrigerator 1 hour prior to use
9. Gently stretch dough into 12-14 inch rounds, top with sauce, cheese, toppings, and bake at high heat in pizza oven.
