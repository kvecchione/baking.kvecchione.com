* **8 oz*** plain greek yogurt (1 cup)

* **2 tsp** vanilla extract
* **5 oz** powdered sugar (.625 cup)
  
## Filling
* **8 oz** unsalted butter (.5 cup)
* **12 oz** light brown sugar, gently packed (1.5) cup)
* **1 oz** ground cinnamon (.25 cup)
* **1 tsp** grated nutmeg
* **.5 tsp** kosher salt (diamond crystal)

# Steps

## Dough
1) In bowl of stand mixer whisk together flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and baking soda until thoroughly combined.
2) Melt butter in microwave for 30-60 seconds, wait 5 minutes to cool.
3) Add butter, yogurt, and milk to dry ingredients in stand mixer bowl and manually stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough.
4) With the hook attachment, knead on medium-low until silky-smooth and elastic, about 20 minutes.
5) Take dough out of mixer and coat with light layer of flour, put in separate bowl and cover with plastic. Set dough to rise for about 120 minutes. Use oven proofer setting if available.

## Filling
1) In stand mixer, mix butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt on low speed with a paddle attachment until moistened.
2) Increase to medium and beat the dark paste until creamy, light in color, and very soft, about 5 minutes.
3) Transfer to a separate bowl.

## Frosting
1) Combine cream cheese and vanilla with half the powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. 
2) Mix on low to moisten, then sprinkle in the rest of the sugar a little at a time.
3) Once it is incorporated, increase to medium and beat until creamy and pale ivory, about 5 minutes.
4) Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. (If your kitchen is chilly and the frosting hardens in that time, briefly microwave the bag to restore its creamy texture before use.)

## Assemble Buns
1) Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, dust with flour, and roll into a 13-inch square.
2) Spread filling into an even layer on the dough with an offset spatula.
3) Roll to form a 12-inch log, ending seam side down.
4) Using an 8-inch strand of unflavored dental floss, cut into 12 equal pieces.
5) Arrange in a parchment-lined 9 inch round aluminum baking pan in a star pattern.
6) Cover with tin foil and place in refrigerator overnight

## Baking
1) Preheat over to 350F and remove dough from refrigerator to allow it to warm (use proofer if neeeded)
2) Bake, covered, until cinnamon rolls are puffed and firm but pale, about 45 minutes.
3) Remove the foil and continue baking until lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.
4) Snip a corner from the bag of frosting, squeeze over the cinnamon rolls
5) Serve immediately, and leave no survivors; lifeâ€™s too short for day-old cinnamon rolls.
